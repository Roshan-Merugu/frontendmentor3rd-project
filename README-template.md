### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of responsive design using media queries and flexbox. Below is an example of the CSS I used for responsiveness:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
  }
}
